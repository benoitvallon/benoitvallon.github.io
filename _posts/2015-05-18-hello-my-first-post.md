# Let's start!

Because everything has a beginning and because when you are a developer there is a special kind of beginning. I will try to make it a little bit different.

```js
console.log('Hello my first post!');
//=> Hello my first post!
```

As new New Yorker for a month and a half now I can't omit this one as well.

```js
console.log('Hello New York!');
//=> Hello New York!
```

# Why this blog?

Quite short for a first post, isn't it? But that the style that I would like to give to this blog. I read a lot of blogs and books about code and I have always felt that they could have been as clear as they are with less talking. I will try to make my posts as clear as I can and limit the talking to focus on code. We are developers after all.

The following coming soon.
